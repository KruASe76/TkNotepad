# TkNotepad

It's a notepad like in Windows 10, but it can't:
1) print
2) execute more than 1 window
3) work with buffer
4) find text
5) change font, only can change the font size

Binds:
- New file: Ctrl+N
- Open file: Ctrl+O
- Save file: Ctrl+S
- Save as: Ctrl+Shift+S
- Search in Bing (in Microsoft's style, yeah): Ctrl+B
- Increase scale: Ctrl+plus
- Decrease scale: Ctrl+minus
- Reset scale: Ctrl+0
- View Help link: Ctrl+H
- View info: Ctrl+I
- View text editing keybinds (if you have forgotten them suddenly): Ctrl+K
- Quit program: Ctrl+Q

I think that's all.
Enjoy)
